- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a bunch of cool projects, most of which are on here
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about random facts
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on twitter, or message Rodentman87#8787 on Discord
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Call me anything, just don't call me at 3 AM to ask if my refrigerator is running (She/Her if you need one)
- âš¡ Fun fact: The file system Lex navigates in Jurassic Park was an actual program made by Silicon Graphics... it looks cool, but seems horribly unusable.
